# Part 3: Spotify Project

This notebook is the final installment in a three-part series:
**A Beginner's Guide to Data Analytics with Python**

### Topics Covered
The notebook applies the lessons learned in Parts 1 and 2 to a real-world dataset:
Top Spotify Podcast Episodes, which I found on Kaggle.

It's a massive repository of data with over 6 million entries in the original CSV file. That sprawling
trove of near-real time information allowed me to explore actionable insights about the world
of podcasting:
- Do podcasts need video to reach Spotify's Top 10?
- What can machine learning models tell us about staying in the Top 50?

Unfortunately, that also means the dataset is far too large to upload to GitHub, (≈450MB), 
so it’s not included in this repo. To run the notebook fully, download the dataset locally —
[download the dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/path-to-your-dataset) — 
and open it in Jupyter.

### Note
This is notebook is a work in progress. The only way to code, is to practice. There are no shorcuts
to the top. Stay tuned for more.
