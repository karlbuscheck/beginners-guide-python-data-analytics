# A Beginner's Guide to Data Analytics with Python

**Using Python to turn data into actionable, easy-to-understand insights.**

This is a three-part series:

- **Part 1: Python Basics** — Time Series, DataFrames, Date Cleaning, and 'group by'
- **Part 2: Intermediate Concepts** — Preprocessing, Visualizing, Merging Data, and Intro to Machine Learning
- **Part 3: Spotify Project** — Building a real-world Machine Learning Model to predict podcast rankings

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** — for writing and running Python code interactively
- **Python 3.12.2**
- **pandas** — for data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** — for numerical operations
- **matplotlib** — for basic plotting
- **seaborn** — for data visualization
- **scikit-learn** — for building machine learning models

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on the notebooks and datasets provided by Yu-Wei Lin, Assistant Professor in the Department of
Information Systems and Analytics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University. Professor Lin's guidance in
our Data Analytics with Python class made this project possible, allowing me to apply and extend the concepts covered in the
course to build this three-part series.

## Note
This notebook is a work in progress. The only way to code is to practice. Stay tuned for more.
